# Slider State Management

This an app made following Google/IO 2019's [Pragmatic State Management in Flutter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I&list=PLHEORSeb47fJ_XSzC3K1aOkgqLBydJ5uc&index=6&app=desktop) talk.

It should be pretty much similar to the sample app shown in the talk and the goal of it is to use the [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) to manage state within a Flutter app.
